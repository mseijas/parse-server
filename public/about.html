          <p class="info-copy">Tailor is a smart closet where data is captured from actions taken by users in the environment through embedded sensors in their clothing and then transformed into information of user intent. With that info we are automatically digitizing the contents of the closet and providing an AI system that offers suggestions on what to wear. Basically, it's the <a href="https://youtu.be/XNDubWJU0aU?t=5s" class="clueless-link">Clueless closet</a> come to life.</p>

          <p class="title">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
          <p class="info-question">Q: How many quesions are in this survey?</p>
          <p class="info-copy">The suvey is used to train the artificial intelligence algorithm by generating random selections of closet items, temperatures, and weather conditions. As such, there is no end to the number of questions that you will be presented with. Please answer as many as you'd like, no compromises!</p>

          <p class="info-question">Q: Should I take into account if the clothing fits my style?</p>
          <p class="info-copy">Please don't take into account whether the piece of clothing fits your style or not. For example, if you are presented with an image of a sweater, we are trying to determine whether you would generally use any kind of sweater when it's cold outside. We're not taking into account whether this particular sweater fits your style or not.</p>

          <p class="info-question">Q: Should I submit an answer assuming that other pieces of clothing will be worn?</p>
          <p class="info-copy">No, only submit an answer based on the information that is shown on the screen. For example, if you are asked whether you would wear a Tshirt in the snow, do not submit your answer based on the assumption that you will also be wearing a jacket. Only consider the information that is shown to you. In this example, you are being asked if you would <em>only</em> wear a Tshirt out when it's snowing.</p>

          <p class="info-question">Q: I have a question that is not listed here. What should I do?</p>
          <p class="info-copy">Please email me at <a href="mailto:matias@nyu.edu">matias@nyu.edu</a>. I would love to hear your feedback!</p>
